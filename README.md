<p style="text-align: justify">👋 Hi, I’m @BernardoSlailati! I'm a mechatronic engineer graduated at CEFET-MG and I've been working with software development since 2018. Since then, I've
worked and studied technologies for the areas of web (front and backend) and mobile.</p>

👀 I'm interested in all the new development environments and tools created to solve problems that I've already faced, especially with a mobile focus!
